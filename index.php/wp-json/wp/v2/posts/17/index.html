When it reveals any data or info regarding a country or on any issue, then it can influence everyone for certain reason. The projection that the World Bank gave yesterday regarding Bangladesh\u2019s GDP growth is inconsistent with the country\u2019s current economic recovery,&#8221; said the minister in a press release.Advertisement<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The finance minister\u2019s remarks came in the wake of the latest \u2018South Asia Economic Focus 2020\u2019 released by the World Bank Thursday.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The Washington-based lending agency projected that the Bangladesh\u2019s GDP growth would likely to be 1.6 per cent in the current fiscal year (FY21) and 3.4 per cent in the next fiscal year (FY22).<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Kamal said whatever the World Bank is saying about the country\u2019s current growth status is not new as they have been revealing such numbers since there has been slowdown in the economy due to Novel Coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic. \u201cThey (WB) are still stuck in the same position (regarding projection),\u201d he added.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The finance minister mentioned that despite enough pressure on the health and pandemic operations management, the timely and appropriate stimulus packages of the government alongside social safety measures have strengthened the economy while basic services and goods have also been ensured for the poor section of people.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Bangladesh is now in a very capable position in almost all areas including private and public investment, public expenditure, export earnings and inward remittance flow, he added.Advertisementhttps:\/\/4e5b86fb0632233297d23ed0aa358fa8.safeframe.googlesyndication.com\/safeframe\/1-0-37\/html\/container.html<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Turning again to the projection of the World Bank, the finance minister said it is known to all that the characteristics of the projection of the World Bank is very much \u2018conservative method\u2019 and if anyone makes a list of their all recent projections, then it would be found that their projections are far away from reality.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>In this regard, Kamal said the government sets its target as per its capacity and thus attains it. \u201cBy attaining, we\u2019ll have to prove time and again that we are correct. Again this time, we\u2019ll prove that our target is right through attaining it.\u201d<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>He also noted that the two per cent cash incentive on remittance through legal channel has increased its flow in the country.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Reiterating that the people of the country is the lifeline of the economy, the finance minister said they would again prove that the World Bank\u2019s projection is inconsistent.Advertisement<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>He said whatever the prime minister had set the growth target in the budget based on her belief on the country\u2019s people, would be achievable.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cWe believe that with the united efforts of all, we\u2019ll be able to attain that target, Insha Allah.
